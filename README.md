# About the project

This is my first attempt to create a to do list with react, and my first real react project.

In the app you can create as many to do-lists as you want, edit them, delete them or set their status to finished.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
